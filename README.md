# theGreatReset

I spent 6 months in a boot camp and learned a ton, but constantly felt like I could spend days, weeks, or months on concepts we spent hours learning and then immediately putting into use. In this repo I will go back to the beginning and learn everything again, but this time in depth in order to master it. Everything will be published here, but some larger projects might get their own repo and be deployed.
